# Executive Summary



### Motivation

If you have a lot of data, you won't have time to look at it one by one for errors or irregularities. It is also quite obvious to resort to percentage change in order to account for the irregularities in the time series data. However, some spikes/dips may be deemed normal and some non-movements in data may also need checking. By using machine learning techniques, the process of checking anomalies can be automated and can possibly be smarter enough to detect which data points need more attention. Hence, the motivation of this project is to reduce man-hours without compromising the quality of detection.
